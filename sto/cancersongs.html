    <h2>Stayin' Alive</h2>
    <div class="song">
Well, you can tell by the way I wear my pump,
I'm a chemo man: gonna get that lump!
Top and bottom, left and right,
Gonna kick it around, I got odds to fight!

But it's all right, It's OK,
The ulcers all will go away.
Got burnin' feet inside my shoes,
but I'm a chemo man and I just can't lose.

whether it's cisplatin, or maybe carboplatin,
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive!
your brain's a ball of cotton and your body's feelin' rotten,
but you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive!

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive!

You can tell by the way I'm movin' quick,
I'm in a hurry man, I'm gonna be sick!
Feeling hot, feelin' numb,
too tired to walk, but I got the runs!

But it's all right, It's OK!
I'll learn to pee another way,
Sat on the john, cause I can't stand,
It's a whole new stance for chemo man!

whether it's cisplatin, or maybe carboplatin,
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive!
your brain's a ball of cotton, and your body's feelin' rotten,
but you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive!

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive!

You can tell by the way I wear my hair,
I'm a chemo man, and I've got none there!
But being bald is all the rage,
at the cancer club, no matter what the age!

And it's alright, it's OK,
I'll wear my hair another way!
with a duster and a polish can,
it's a whole new look for chemo man!

whether it's cisplatin, or maybe carboplatin,
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive!
your brain's a ball of cotton, and your body's feelin' rotten,
but you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive!

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive!

      <h2>Hangin' around</h2>
      <div class="song">
He got the diagnosis,
and accepted the prognosis,
he's scared of getting thinner,
but he hasn't lost a pound,
he's just hangin' around!
He's still hangin' around!

With metallic drugs they filled him,
the chemo nearly killed him,
radiation got his nerves,
almost burned him to the ground,
but he's hangin' around!
He's still hangin' around!

The surgeon's hands were skillful,
as they sliced him with a scalpel,
and the doctor cut his throat,
and he didn't make a sound,
He's still hangin' around!
Hangin' around!

He's still hangin' around!
Hangin' around!
He's just hangin' around!
Hangin' around!
He's still hangin' around!
Hangin' around!

They said they got the cancer,
so he thought he'd be a chancer,
and he lit a cigarette,
for his old ways he had found,
but he's hangin' around!
Hangin' around!
he's still hangin' around!
Hangin' around!

The beast came back for seconds,
but he confidently reckons,
that he showed him once before
and he'll beat him this time round,
He's just hangin' around!
Hangin' around!
He's still hangin' around!
Hangin' around!

The surgeon's hands were skillful,
as they sliced him with a scalpel,
and the doctor cut his throat,
and he didn't make a sound,
He's still hangin' around!
Hangin' around!

Hangin' around!
He's just hangin' around!
Hangin' around!
He's still hangin' around!
Hangin' around!

<h2>Fight On EC Survivor</h2>

      <div class="song">
Remember when you could eat?
Swallow dry bread and meat?
Shine on E C survivor!
Now yu feel wasted and thin,
and you're sure you can't win...
fight on E C survivor!

You were caught on the crossfire of bad luck and reflux,
and told that the beast can't lose!
Come on you target for cancer statistics,
come on you brothers, you sisters, you winners, and fight!
The chemo's been makin' you weak.
but it fights while you sleep!
Fight on E C survivor!

threatened with nausea and pain,
think of George Marc or Jane,
and fight on E C survivor!
well they tore out your gullet with random precision,
and joined the remains to your throat.
Come on you fellows, you seers of visions...
come on you tiring, you fearing, denying, and fight!

You're scared that you might not survive,
but you're still so alive!
Fight on EC survivor!
The hill just seems too steep to climb.
One step at a time.
Climb on EC survivor!

Are you stubborn, defying?
Or, dieing denying?
Losing your will to eat?
Come on you starving, you choking, you parting,
come on you winners, you lovers, you shiners, and shine!

      </div>

      <h2>When I'm Sixty Four</h2>

      <div class="song">
When I'm on chemo losing my hair,
many weeks from now,
carboplatin through an intravenous line,
5-F-U, pumpin' in time!
If I'm in the bathroom till a quarter to three,
you can knock the door.
Will I have EC,
will you still feed me,
when I'm sixty four?

We could write a book about the times when you were cookin' eight meals a day,
and I'll make do with five!
I could wear all your hand me downs,
now I'm more your size!
I could be handy mending a fuse,
if my pump has blown.

You could clean my tube out by the fireside,
Every morning, crying inside.
we could make love at 20 degrees,
Who could ask for more?
Will I have EC,
will you still feed me,
when I'm sixty-four?

We would think it funny, they remodelled my new tummy,
twenty years ago.
And now it's all the rage!
And kids all over the world are named,
Ivor, Lewis and Jane!

I could have doctors scratching their heads,
because their stats were wrong.
We could read our email by the fireside,
telling people, I'm still alive!
We could sing songs on Cathy's Cafe.
George would yell for more!
Will I have EC?
Will you still feed me?
When I'm 64.

    </div>

    <h2>Help me make it through the fight!</h2>

    <div class="song">
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
roll your sleeves up, bite your lip
and put your back against the wall!

Come and sit here by my side,
give me strength and hold me tight.
All I need is all your love,
to help me make it through this fight!

We wont care who's right or wrong,
cause all the docs don't understand,
how we fight for more tomorrows,
and get our power from holding hands!

Drugs and knives wont work alone,
and I'm using all my might.
I need your strength to carry on.
Help me make it through the fight!

    </div>

    <h2> The Twelve Days Of Treatment</h2>
      A slight variation on the traditional tune

    <div class="song">
On the first day of treatment,
My doctor used a scope,
That's a camera on the end of a piece of rope!

On my second day of treatment,
He used an ultrasound,
And he told me exactly what he found!

On the third day of treatment,
I lay down for a scan,
And I wondered if I would get a tan!

On the fourth day of treatment,
He used a scanner called a PET,
Something told me he wasn't finished yet!

On the fifth day of treatment,
He said there was a lump,
So they issued me with a 5FU pump!

On the sixth day of treatment,
I was sat upon the loo,
And the mouth sores were pretty nasty too!

On the seventh day of treatment,
The lump began to shrink,
And guess what? I could eat and drink!

On the eighth day of treatment,
I thought the doc was nuts,
When he told me he'd take away my guts!

On the ninth day of treatment,
He put me off to sleep,
In a room where machines would all go beep!

On the tenth day of treatment,
I couldn't eat a thing,
And this verse is the hardest verse to sing!

On the eleventh day of treatment,
My wounds began to heal,
And at last, I could eat a proper meal!

On the twelth day of treatment,
My doctor said to me,
"Go home Ray, I think you're cancer free!"

    </div>

        <h2> Nights on Cisplatin</h2>
        To the tune of Nights in White Satin by the Moody Blues

        <div class="song">
Nights on cisplatin,
Never reaching the end.
Sweatin' and shiverin'
With aches in my head.

Sick in my belly
Numb fingers and toes,
A dry mouth with ulcers
A wet runny nose.

But I'm fightin'!
Yes, I'm fightin'!
Oh how I'm fightin'!

Tinnitus ringing,
Sounds in the air,
Losing my hearing
As fast as my hair.

Thinkin' of people
Who have played the same hand .
Just what I'm goin' through
They can understand .

'Cause we're fightin'!
Yes, we're fightin'!
Oh, how we're fightin'!

Nights on cisplatin,
Never reaching the end.
Sleepless and dreamless
Hours to spend.

Slumber is always missed
Like all nights before.
Is this what the cure is?
I can't tell anymore!

But I'm fightin'!
Yes, I'm fightin'!
Oh, how I'm fightin'!

Yes, we're fightin'!
We're all fightin'!
Oh, how we're fightin'!

        </div>

        <h2>Diet? What Diet?</h2>

        <div>
            <p>
In the beginning God covered the earth with broccoli, cauliflower and spinach, with green,
yellow and red vegetables of all kinds so Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.
            </p><p>
Then using God's bountiful gifts, Satan created Dairy Ice Cream and Eskimo Pies. And Satan
said "You want hot fudge with that? And Man said "Yes!" And Woman said "I'll have one too
with chocolate chips".
And lo they gained 10 pounds.
        </p><p>

And God created the healthy yoghurt that woman might keep the figure that man found so fair.
And Satan brought forth white flour from the wheat and sugar from the cane and combined
them. And Woman went from size 12 to size 14.
        </p><p>

So God said "Try my fresh green salad". And Satan presented Blue Cheese dressing and garlic
croutons on the side. And Man and Woman unfastened their belts following the repast.
God then said "I have sent you healthy vegetables and olive oil in which to cook them". And
Satan brought forth deep fried coconut king prawns, butter-dipped lobster chunks and chicken
fried steak, so big it needed its own platter and Man's cholesterol went through the roof.
        </p><p>

Then God brought forth the potato, naturally low in fat and brimming with potassium and good nutrition.
        </p><p>

Then Satan peeled off the healthy skin and sliced the starchy centre into chips and deep fried
them in animal fats adding copious quantities of salt. And Man put on more pounds. God then
brought forth running shoes so that his Children might lose those extra pounds.
        </p><p>

And Satan came forth with a cable TV with remote control so Man would not have to toil
changing the channels. And Man and Woman laughed and cried before the flickering light and
started wearing stretch jogging suits.
        </p><p>

Then God gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and still satisfy his
appetite.
        </p><p>

And Satan created McDonalds and the 99cent double cheeseburger. Then Satan said "You
want fries with that?" And Man replied "Yes, And super size 'em". And Satan said "It is good."
And Man and Woman developed esophageal cancer.
        </p><p>

God sighed .......... and created the trans-hiatal esophagectomy and the minimally invasive
technique too.
        </p><p>

And then ............. Satan chuckled and created HMOs and the National Health Service!
        </p>

    <h2>The EC Olympics, 2008</h2>
        <div class="song">
It was a day for us all to remember,
For the turn out was truly immense.
As dozens of EC Group members,
Were prepared for their varied events.

Niel brought the flame from South Africa,
In a torch that was shaped like a heart.
It seemed fitting to have something symbolic of,
How our EC began at the start!

And each ring on the flag that we're wavin',
Marks a milestone in something we strive.
For each one's a year that we're savin',
To be cured when we've gotten all five!

Ceremonies over, the games'll soon begin.
Pumps and I.V. drips all tested clear.
And dozens of EC patients were standing in Beijing,
Wonderin', "What the hell am I doing here?"

Stomophaguses curdled,
As runners ran and jumped,
In the hundred meter hurdles,
Carryin' tubes and bags and pumps.

Wrestlers with piccs on their left arm,
Held their 5F.U. pump in their right.
And using the line that connects them,
Started skipping, warming up for the fight.

The relay's a race for the carers.
As they're always the helping hands!
Perriwinkle blue staff bearers,
Running hard from scan to scan.

Judy Anderson's sprinting broke the clock!
A hundred meters ran in record time!
From the diner down behind the starting blocks,
To the toilets just beyond the finish line!

Judith took a bad dive from the top!
But her loss was truly her gain.
Cause her belly hit the pool with a flop;
Now she's presently belching again!

Self-dilatation, this year's new discipline.
And roger and Marny are to judge.
Some dilator bougies easily slippin' in,
And others that just wouldn't budge!

And Australia is takin' home gold,
For the long jump and high jump too!
Both won by a bald girl on a roll,
Known as "Chrissy the Kangaroo"!

Swimmers were sealing their ports,
In a hydrodynamical way.
And contestants of trampoline sports,
Had been starving themselves the whole day!

George T in the pole vault did well!
"But I didn't enter!", he explains,
"I was in a hurry to Taco Bell,
When my walking cane stuck in the drain!"

Ahem! I got a gold for the discus.
But I thank all the practice I got,
Sendin' all of those discs long distance.
Next year, I'm putting the shot!

I called out "Good luck!" to Marc Wolfgram,
Who was holding a long, thin cigar.
But it seems that I spoke to the javelins,
Cause Marc's on the parallel bars!

John Parkes won a medal on his pedals,
And Mara danced away with a gold!
The decathalon belongs to Bruce Triebold,
The pentathalon, Dick Stienmier, I'm told.

Well, what can I say about the marathon?
Cause sure it's the same every year!
For as long as Jane Pickett's in the runnin',
There'll be no catchin' up, I fear!

John Steffen and Andy Leary,
Bill Churchill and Python revved up,
For the EC Olympic Bike Rally,
And the Larry McElderry cup!

The EC Olympics was endin',
With medals and champagne and cheer!
And we all went back to our mendin',
For another survivable year!

        </div>

<h2>The EC Banquet</h2>

    <div class="song">
It was the EC Banquet, two thousand and eight,
And an hour and a half since everyone ate.
So, appetites were good,
As they awaited their food,
And they talked of their various states.

Marc and Tammy were the first on the floor,
With a "Welcome all!" and a "Thank you, ACOR."
Tammy joked of EC,
Marc warned, "keep it PC!"
Hmmm, he can't be into Macintosh no more!

Mickey from PA started to chat,
While Down-Under Chrissy was stroking her cat.
They talked about fare,
And losing their hair,
And they talked about when they were fat!

Steve Preston, with his nose bag on,
Full of Nexium pills, wasn't sharin' with John!
And the Jankles near choked,
As George Thompson joked,
'Bout his prostate, and how much it had grown!

Judy Anderson told us so,
And she's a doctor too, you know!
That if it's not constipation,
It's bowel irritation.
And Marny said, "Gentle as you go!"

Colin Pollard, with statistics made a case,
While Python and Dick Dickerman, looked him in the face.
And from Chicago, John Parkes,
Told us when his dog barks,
That it's scan time, and no time to waste!

Lois Dickerman explained why we're sick,
And she showed us how to beat it, just like Dick.
And Sandi the rebel,
Stood up on the table,
And gave the morale of the carers a kick!

Ray and Rachael got up to sing a song,
But some thought Ray had got the words all wrong.
Les talked 'bout the stars,
Far beyond planet Mars,
And our futures through his telescope seemed long!

Oh, the smells that the kitchen was makin'!
John Thomas there, overseeing the bakin'.
Kris from Columbus,
Had tummy rumbles,
And we agreed, 'bout how long it was takin'!

Then the meal was brought out on a dish,
Potatoes, tomatoes, and fish,
Cheese sauce and bean sprouts,
Mushrooms and sauerkraut,
And the conversation died with a "Sshhh!"

The size of the plate was monstrophagus,
For a group with just one esophagus.
And they stared at the mountain,
Calory countin',
Until Marc said, "It's one plate for all of us!"

And to those who think they're excluded,
From these verses, their names not included.
I'm makin' a list,
Of those who I've missed,
Cause this poem has not been concluded!

        </div>

    <h2>The EC Banquet - Part 2 - The After Dinner Speeches</h2>

    <div class="song">
Judith stood contorted, and burped with arms in air.
And she thanked us all for coming, and offered up the chair.
She asked for volunteers
To stand and give a cheer,
And any stories we might have to share!

Calvin dog was first up on his paws,
With his 5FU pump swinging from his jaws.
He barked and woofed and honked
About his veterinary onc,
And how he'll be pointing out prognostic flaws!

George Thompson spoke of Nam and his latest news,
And he got us all to sign a bottle of booze,
He was taking to his surgeon;
It was an annual occasion,
To celebrate each extra year he choose!

A rapturous round of applause filled the hall,
As Bob the Greeter welcomed one and all.
For ten years now, Mr Marvin
Has given up on starvin',
A true fighter with his back against the wall!

Ellen from eighty nine showed picture poses,
Of when she stood as one of Parkes's roses.
Then three Rogers in a row
Told us everything they know,
About dilations, operations, and scoping hoses!

Desserts and drinks arrived, though some thought early.
Some drank from the vine and some drank barley.
And a few were eating great,
While others watched their weight,
Though the only "Fat Boy" there was the Steffen's Harley!

A few were pouring coffee down their stents,
And some just chewed on after dinner mints.
But the stories carried on,
Some of joy and some forlorn,
And some common incidents and accidents!

The other Mickey from chicago, Illinois,
Raised a glass to the first year out for John and Joy.
And Alyce had no shyness
When she spoke of mets to the sinus,
And how proud she was of her fighting husband, Cloyce!

Guy Churchill gave us all an anecdote,
Somethin' 'bout us all been in the same boat.
And Lisa and Andy Leary
Were soundin' really cheery,
Claiming N.E.D. were the nicest words they wrote!

The Jankles, with Clyde Davis, Gene and Lou,
Assembled as a band, "The Motley Crew".
And in harmony all five
Sang a song called "Stayin' Alive",
And shouted out to Ray, "This one's for you!"

A story from a newby was requested.
Linda's Bill asked how food could be digested.
And we remembered as a group
When we all lived on soup,
And we told him it gets better, once you've rested!

Then the radiant Jane Pickett took the floor,
Still glowing from the rays of seventy four.
And she rambled on and nattered
Just as if it hadn't mattered,
And she gave us all a dream to reach out for!

So standing up, all singing Auld Lang Syne,
We vowed to meet again in two thousand nine.
But if you haven't had a mention,
It means you're only on detention,
Because the night's not over yet, there's cheese and wine!
