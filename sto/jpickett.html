                    <p>
                    In 1974, at age 34, I was diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the
                    Esophagus.  I had felt as if there was a problem for two years prior to
                    diagnosis.  I first went to an Ear Nose and Throat doctor in Raleigh,
                    NC, pointedly asked him if I had cancer and his response was "No
                    Honey it's just your nerves."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We moved to Lake Worth, Florida and
                        about a year later I went to see another Ear Nose and Throat doctor
                        who prescribed tranqualizers for my "Nerves" and sent me home.  I
                        continued to suffer with terrible indigestion and finally got to the point
                        where I couldn't even swallow liquids and lost a great deal of weight in
                        a short period of time.  I consulted an Internist, he hospitalized me and
                        a large mass was found in my esophagus.  We then went to Miami for a
                        biopsy which first came back negative but the surgeon, Dr. Lombardi
                        wasn't convinced that the results were correct and felt we should do
                        another biopsy which came back positive for squamous cell carcinoma
                        of the esophagus.  At the time, he told us it was a very fast growing,
                        aggressive type of cancer and described the surgery done for this type as
                        very radical,  it was disfiguring, losing the larynx and lymp nodes in the
                        neck. He said we had to go to a larger hospital to have this surgery
                        considered, such as Slone Kettering or Washington University, that he
                        did not perform such a surgery.  We were told to get our affairs in
                        order, that I had only a few weeks to six months to live.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After conferring with our cousin Dr. Crowder who was at Oschners in New
                        Orleans, we decided to go to a Dr. Joseph Ogura, a specialist in St.
                        Louis, at Barnes Medical Center,  Washington University.  He and a Dr.
                        Roper performed another biopsy.  The tumor was located at the very
                        top of the esophagus and was much larger than they expected, the
                        tumor  extended to the level of criccopharyngeous muscle and extended
                        from the cricopharyngeous through T-2. it had broken thru the wall of
                        the esophagus.  He told us that there was nothing that could be done for
                        me, that it was inoperable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had good friends at the University of
                        Florida,  who happened to be head of the Physicians Assistant program
                        there, and had made a few contacts at the hospital.  I mentioned one of
                        the doctors names and Dr.  Ogura had trained this doctor.  He made a
                        call for us and we arranged to see a Dr. Rodney Million, radiation
                        oncologist at the University Hospital, Shands in Gainesville, Florida.  It
                        was not certain that any hospital would agree to treat me, but Dr.
                        Million agreed to do so.  It was at the time a rather experimental
                        procedure as I was told later by one of the doctors.  They built little
                        sandbags to help protect my spine from the radiation, there was a very
                        high percentage that if I survived the cancer, I could be paralyzed from
                        the neck down due to radiation damage to the spine.  This risk was
                        explained to me many times, but we had no choice, radiation was my
                        only option.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        My primary radiation oncologist was Dr. Steven Terry Kraus.
                        Dr. Kraus, will forever be my "HERO", he had a very upbeat
                        personality and was extremely caring and kind, I felt he was truly
                        interested in me as a person and wanted very badly to succeed.  He used
                        as an example a woman he knew had survived for 6 years after EC, so
                        that 6 years became my goal.  I had Anaplastic  Squamous cell
                        carcinoma  of cervical and  upper thoratic esophagus,  8cm, it had
                        broken thru the wall of the esophagus.  I was to receive 7,000 R tumor
                        dose using four field isocentric technique, split course reducing fields at
                        5,000 R tumor dose. and my prognosis for a five year survival was 5%
                        at best.  This was the only treatment I was to receive for my cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The front of the neck was treated each day, alternating both sides of the
                    neck and back.  For about a year after my treatments, I experienced a
                    tingling sensation each time I would bend my neck, this went all the way
                    to my toes.  I had a radiation fracture to the spine.  There has been no
                    paralysis to the spine.  I have to be dilated every three months as I have
                    a tight stricture from scar tissue that built up from the radiation.  I was
                    at first apprenhesive about the dilations fearing that if we disturbed the
                    area, the cancer would return, that is no longer a concern, as I've had
                    hundreds of them.  I have had some problems with aspiration
                    pneumonia after dilations, but my doctor now props me higher with a
                    pillow and uses Rubinol to dry the mucus prior to dilation, this has
                    worked well for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't believe the doctors know the long term
                        cumulative effects of having so much radiation, I have continued to have
                        some problems crop up, even after 40 years.  In 1999, I had to have a
                        triple by pass that was attributed to the radiation, also in 2013, after a
                        dilation, I experienced problems with swallowing, two more dilations
                        were done the next week,  but nothing was found, and the swallowing
                        improved.  I began the round of doctors again, was referred to a
                        Larynologist at the University of Mississippi, Dr. Sweinforth.  He
                        determined that I had paralysis of the larynx, the right side completely
                        paralyzed and only 30% use of the left side.  He felt this was a
                        culmulative effect from the radiation I received.  This is not reversible,
                        and can possibly get worse.  I like to think it won't get any worse.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had
                        a Pulmonologist that wanted to put in a J-tube because of my
                        aspirations and multiple pneumonias, but I didn't feel this would solve
                        the problem and felt it was not for me.  I have since changed
                        Pulmonologist.   I have had two squamous cell skin cancers removed
                        and I have had Malt Lymphoma, a form of non-hodgkins lymphoma.
                        This was treated in 1997 with strong antibiotics and was put into
                        remission.  This was not considered connected with my original EC.
                        What a small price to pay for 40 years of survival.  My life has been so
                        blessed.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        I was a light smoker, and only drank occasionally.  I lived on the Island

                        of Guam for two years as a child, and I recall my brother and I running

                        behind a truck that was spraying DDT for mosquitos and breathing the

                        fumes, this happened at least two nights a week.  The doctors didn't feel

                        this was a factor in the development of my cancer, but I've always

                        wondered, I also refurnished quite a bit of furniture prior to my

                        diagnosis and have wondered if the furniture stripper might have had

                        some bearing on the development of the cancer.  I remember having

                        quite a bit of indigestion as a teenager, but that was in the mid 50s and

                        you just didn't go to the doctor for that type of thing.  Cancer was very

                        prevalent on my mothers side of the family, affecting almost all my

                        aunts and uncles and grandparents in various ways.

                    My husband Jim and I have been married for 54 years, have 3 children,

                    9 grandchildren and 2  great grandchildren.  My boys were 12 and 13

                    and my daughter turned 4 the week after I was diagnosed.  My parents

                    came to care for them and my husband while I lived in Gainesville with

                    our friends while undergoing my radiation treatments.  When I

                    returned home, my days were very busy caring for three young children

                    and running a household, I found the nights to the hardest, that was

                    when my mind had time to dwell on my situation.  It was hard to think

                    long term.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        After a few months of this, I decided to change my life and I
                        became active in a community center in our area.  I set up exercise

                        programs, bowling teams, belly dancing, haunted houses and parties,

                        also served on the Board of Directors.  My husband and I took up tennis

                        and made many good friends along the way.  Some nights, I would go

                        home totally exhausted, but whatever I was doing was keeping me alive,

                        I have since worked and owned two businesses.  We are retired and live

                        on a lake in Madison, Mississippi.  I stay very active and you would not

                        know to see me that I have had any life threatening diseases.

                        I wish I had the cure for this terrible disease, so that I might pass it on

                        to all of you.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        It is a very sobering thing when you come to the

                        realization that there is not one human being in the whole world who

                        can help you.  I can only speak for myself, but for me, I feel it was the

                        care of my wonderful doctors, the prayers on my behalf, although, I

                        have never felt I was deserving of such a miracle, and the body's ability

                        to heal itself.  I hope I haven't rambled too much, but if I can give just

                        one person the will to fight this cancer even harder, then I have

                        achieved something.  I know surgery may limit a persons ability to do

                        everything I did and metastasis can be grim, but try your mightiest to

                        think as positive as you can and make each day a good one.
