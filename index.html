            <h3>EC Caf&eacute; History</h3>
            <p>
                The EC Café web site was launched by Cathy Byland-Weeks on December 29th, 1995.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Cathy's father, John Byland, was diagnosed with EC in October of 1995, she discovered
                that there wasn't a whole lot on the Internet about this form of cancer. Cathy’s father survived
                EC 17 years until at age 74 he died of Multiple Systems Atrophy on March 6, 2014
            </p>
            <p>
                After 3 years of dedicated support Cathy handed over the Café to Tammy and Marc Wolfgram
                on December 29th, 1998.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the next 10 years Marc and Tammy revised and enhanced the Café as it became the place
                to look for factual esophageal cancer information and support for new EC patients. Marc was
                diagnosed with EC in 1995. For many years Marc was also the list manager of EC-Group on
                ACOR (Association of Cancer Online Resources). After surviving EC for 15 years Marc died in
                a tragic automobile accident February 15, 2010.
            </p>


            <h3>The EC Caf&eacute; Today </h3>
            <p>
                After the Café web address was taken over by a Japanease hair company the Café content was
                rescued from web archives by Smart Patients. Tammy gave permission to John Parkes to work
                with Smart Patients to update the Café. John was diagnosed with EC in April, 2000.
            </p>

            <h3>Esophageal Cancer Community at Smart Patients</h3>
            <p align="left">
                For many years The EC Café went hand-in-hand with the <b>EC Group at ACOR</b>. In June,
                2013, EC Group moved from ACOR to the esophageal cancer community at
                <a href='http://www.smartpatients.com/esophageal-cancer'>Smart Patients.</a>
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                While a web site, like this Caf&eacute;, is a good place for permanent sources of information, pictures and stories,
                the EC-Group has a much more dynamic, personal touch.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                There people can discuss problems, carry on dialogues about the good and bad aspects of any treatment,
                and can offer individual support. However, both the Caf&eacute; and the EC community at Smart Patients
                are designed to let you know that you are NOT ALONE.
            </p>

                    <li>Statistics are just numbers, while you are a living, breathing human being. An individual.</li>
                    <li>
                        Published statistics are usually outdated by the time they get published, and then they hang
                        around in cyberspace and may be <i>extremely</i> outdated by the time you find them and read them.
                    </li>
