        <p>This is a collection of limericks that the members of the EC-Group wrote. These poems reveal that we have a lot of bad poets on the list, but more importantly than that, they reveal the humor that can be found in a difficult situation.</p>
          <p>The humor ranges from very dark, to very irreverent, to just plain funny.</p>
          <p>We hope you enjoy them, and the insight they provide.</p>

          <p align="center">There was an old shopper in Dallas<br>
            Whose gastroenterologist practiced with malice.<br>
            He warned the old gent:<br>
"If you eat beans you will excessively vent<br>
            and your esophagus will develop a callus!"</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">A shopper and avid consumer,<br>
            Developed a malignant tumor,<br>
            When Blue Cross paid the bill,<br>
            It gave her such a thrill,<br>
            That she cried, "I'll take one or two more!"</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">The oncologist at the "C" clinic<br>
            Said, "Dear, it won't be a picnic.<br>
            But if you'll pay each big bill<br>
            I'll have dough in the till<br>
            To send all my kids to Cal Polytechnic."</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">It took "three score and two"<br>
            To learn not to offend 'you...you...and...you.<br>
            But now without warning<br>
            My stomach starts storming<br>
            And I'll *BELCH* right out of the blue!</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">The esophagus truly is fickle...<br>
            To repair costs you one pretty nickel<br>
            And don't get an urge...<br>
            for what makes you purge..<br>
            Please... don't eat a big garlic pickle..!!</p>

          <p align="center">There once was a man from MO<br>
            Who got EC which knocked him down low<br>
            But then he got better<br>
            And became a go-getter<br>
            And camping in Minnesota he'll go!</p>

          <p align="center">The up-to-date baby boomer,<br>
            When faced with a cancerous tumor,<br>
            Eats raw shark and green tea,<br>
            Grape seed, vitamin 'C',<br>
            And develops a dark sense of humor.</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">There once was a fellow named Gus,<br>
            with a stomach as his esophagus,<br>
            after surgery and chemo and rad,<br>
            ('cause that's the best that they had),<br>
            he never regretted the fuss!</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">Thanks to cancer esophageal,<br>
            At last I can see the whole deal --<br>
            To be born is to die,<br>
            And to laugh is to cry,<br>
            And life's point is to keep down a meal.</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">With a stomach quite a bit smaller<br>
            You can fill it up for less than a dollar.<br>
            The food gets there quicker<br>
            Without using liquor,<br>
"And the neck size, sir?" "Oh..a much narrower collar!"</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">Here was a lightfooted guy from Cal<br>
            Who wooed a tough talkin' gal.<br>
            He knew he'd made a connection<br>
            When he 'fessed up his affection<br>
            and she whispered a soft, "ah, gee, Al."</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">Too bad for my poor brother Steve..<br>
            His tough news is hard to believe<br>
            His motto to beat<br>
            was once: "All you can eat"...<br>
            Alas, it's now all you can heave!</p>
          <hr width="100">
          <p align="center">My sweet Joe from New Yawk City,<br>
            Got EC but still he was witty.<br>
            He called up his folks,<br>
            And told them great jokes.<br>
            He wanted a party, not pity.</p>
