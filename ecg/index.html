      <h1 align="center">Esophageal Cancer (EC) Community at Smart Patients on ACOR</h1>
      <h3 align="left">Background</h3>
      <p>The EC-Group at ACOR started in 1996.

      In June, 2013, EC-Group moved from ACOR to

      the <a href="https://www.smartpatients.com/esophageal-cancer">Esophageal Cancer Community at Smart

      Patients.</a></p>
      <p>Smart Patients is an online community for

      motivated patients and their families and friends.

      In the Esophageal Cancer Community you

      can learn at your own level about scientific

      developments related to your condition,

      share your questions and concerns with other

      members, and use what you learn in the context

      of your own life</p>


            <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
            <p>
                If you or a loved one suffer from a rare condition

                you should not consider any wikipedia article to

                be an inclusive source of information regarding

                that condition. Due to the strict editing guidelines

                of wikipedia, some of the most useful sources of

                hard to find information regarding your condition,

                including patient communities like Smart

                Patients, cannot be mentioned in any article. In

                conclusion, wikipedia articles should be neither

                the first nor the principal source of information

                to give to a newly diagnosed patient, since

                wikipedia doesn't accept, in principle, mention of

                any patient-generated information because that

                information is not considered "authoritative".
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><em><strong>&mdash; Gilles Frydman, </strong>One of Smart Patients Founders</em></p>
            </blockquote>

              <h3>Using Smart Patients</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to get the most benefit from Smart

                    Patients the most important thing is to participate

                    both asking and answering questions.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Be sure to check the tutorials, videos and

                        frequently asked questions. The Smart Patients

                        team is very willing to help with using the site.

                    <h3>Is an Online Community for You?</h3>
                    <p>There is a need for on-line support for

                    people with EC as well as their caregivers,

                    because there are not a lot of other sources

                    for information. New treatments are being

                    developed and people are surviving longer.

                    There is a growing community of patients and

                    caregivers who look to each other for tips, ideas

                    and information that they are not always able to

                    get from their doctors.</p>

                          <p>
                              The community has a fund of knowledge

                              about the latest advances in treatment;

                              new chemotherapy agents; clinical trials; or

                              innovative procedures.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              Community members trade hints and tips for all

                              those little things that the medical professionals

                              do not tell you. Things like what kinds of foods

                              to avoid/try during chemo; how to manage

                              hygiene despite a 24-hour chemo pump; how to

                              keep a j-tube from clogging; what to expect after

                              surgery; how to cope with ?chemo-brain?; or how

                              to navigate the insurance maze.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              The scarcity of information from professional

                              health care providers is especially pronounced

                              during the long-term survival phase. The

                              community members who have made it long

                              enough to be discharged by their doctors as

                              needing no further follow-up usually still have a

                              number of ?late effects? to deal with, and there

                              is usually no textbook nor any ?expert? to turn

                              to for help. Instead we help each other to help

                              ourselves. We, as a community, are still writing

                              the book on this subject, via groups and sites

                              like <a href="https://www.smartpatients.com/esophageal-cancer">Smart Patients</a>.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              They say it takes a village to raise a child --- It

                              also takes a village to nurse a sick person. For

                              EC, the on-line community is that village.
